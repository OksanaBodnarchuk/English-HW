Hi! I'm Oksana. I'm 40 years old. I programmed in Basic at school. Now I'm studying front-end development. I like to solve puzzles, sudoku, read books, more science fiction or fantasy, draw, take pictures. I love the sea, the warm climate, nature fills me, calms me. My strengths are communication skills, the ability to work in a team.  I have two children, my stress resistance is trained)  I really enjoy learning and developing myself. In your company, I am looking for a friendly team, an opportunity to grow and train my programming skills.
